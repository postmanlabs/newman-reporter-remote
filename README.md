# newman-reporter-remote
A Remote reporter for [Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) that posts aggregated information for each execution
in a collection run to the remote location or save to disk in JSON format.
This needs to be used in conjunction with Newman so that it can recognize Remote reporting options.

## Install
> The installation should be global if Newman is installed globally, local otherwise. (Replace -g from the command below with -S for a local installation)

```console
$ npm install -g newman-reporter-remote
```

## Usage
In order to enable this reporter, specify `remote` in Newman's `-r` or `--reporters` option.

```console
# saving execution summary to disk
$ newman run collection.json -r remote --reporter-remote-export './summary.json'

# posting execution summary to remote endpoint
$ newman run collection.json -r remote --reporter-remote-api '{"url": "http://localhost:3000", "method": "POST"}'
```

### Options

#### With Newman CLI

| CLI Option  | Description       |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `--reporter-remote-run-id <runId>` | Set custom run id. (default: UUID4) |
| `--reporter-remote-source <source>` | Set remote execution source. (default: `newman-reporter-remote@<version>`) |
| `--reporter-remote-export <path>` | Specify a path where the output JSON file will be written to disk. If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory. |
| `--reporter-remote-api <json>` | Specify the [request.js options](https://github.com/request/request/#requestoptions-callback) which will be used to post execution summary to the specified endpoint. |

#### With Newman as a Library
The CLI functionality is available for programmatic use as well.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/sample-collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    reporters: 'remote',
    reporter: {
        remote: {
            // set custom run id
            runId: '12345',

            // set remote execution source
            source: 'TestApp@1.2.3',

            // export execution summary to disk
            // if path is not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            export: './summary.json',

            // post execution summary to remote endpoint
            // request.js(https://github.com/request/request) options object
            api: {
                url: 'http://localhost:3000',
                method: 'POST'
            },

            // custom handling of execution summary
            callback: function (err, summary) {
                // custom logic goes here
            }
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
	if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```
